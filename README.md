# SegNet on Cityscapes Dataset

Implementation of SegNet(https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561) on the cityscape dataset(https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
The project focuses on the pixel level semantic segmentation of urban scenarios by implementing segnet deep convolutional neural
network architecture.

The model architecture was coded on colab jupyter notebook, and dataset used is from cityscape dataset.

The file with SegNetandIAL.ipnyb (https://github.com/pa56/SegNetonCityscapes/blob/main/SegNetandIAL.ipynb) has the final code with implementation of Importance Awareness Loss function

Following is the example of some urban images and ground truth for semantic segmentation.
